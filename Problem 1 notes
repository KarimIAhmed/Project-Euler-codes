"If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000."

update 1:
My first instinct would be to make 2 arrays that finds the multiples for 3 and 5, then adding the numbers inside both these arrays, and 
finally adding the 2 numbers to get the solution. However, this does sound like too much code, and I'm thinking of finding an easier way
to do this.

update 2: 
Ya I realized I can just set the condition in the parameter for one array to satisfy the division both 3 and 5,instead of making 2 
seperate arrays. I feel so smart.
